AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> ../final-fastq-set/G211_Watkins07_AVR_r16007_B_D168_RNA1_Lib1_GL102_S105_R1_001.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	7799	AGATCGGAAGAGC	1000000	0.78
smallRNA	4	TGGAATTCTCGG	1000000	0.00
Nextera	2	CTGTCTCTTATA	1000000	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 7799). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 4)
