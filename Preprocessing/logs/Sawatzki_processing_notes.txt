	Deleted SAM output after mapping because they took up 5.5TB
FASTQC OK
Viral check OK
	Checked 7 fastqs for evidence of SIV and HIV (challenge);
		VSV, RRV and adenovirus type 5 (vaccine vectors);
		Malaria, ZIKV, YFV, Influenza (matrix), DENV, Measles and Chlamydia (in notes, possible challenges?)
	Libraries checked cover all pathogens and post-challenge time points
		Two false positive hits (<40bp) for HIV and adenovirus, respectively
		Possible plasmodium and chlamydia hits in all samples, but still at very low overall numbers and many are <40bp (uniques):

	Cross checked and we can assume false positives - tested high quality hits were normal bacteria
STAR OK
	Align with sorting for MrQCSluice
Check STAR errors OK
	Found 3 initial errors (G275-277) - files looked ok and might have been a slurm re-run mix up, but deleted all files and re-mapped
STAR summary OK
MrQCSluice OK
	No suspected sample swaps
	Delete vcfs to clean up
Count matrix OK
